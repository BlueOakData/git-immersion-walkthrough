# LAB 1 through LAB 10

 - if `$ git commit` without `-m` for a comment/message attached to the commit:
  - Write the comment on the first line without a `#`
  - Then hit escape
  - Then type `:wq` (to write & quit)
 - the basic navigation commands you'll need:
  - `cd file_path` this is how you get around the file folders on your machine
  - `cd ..` this goes up a level
  - `git status` will let you know what changes are in what state
