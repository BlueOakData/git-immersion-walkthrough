# git-immersion-walkthrough

This repository is meant to be a guide to learning git via the Git Immersion tour.

I am not the author(s) nor maintainers of that tutorial; I found it to be extremely valuable in my analytics & data engineering journey.

## How to Learn Git

1. Complete [Ruby in Twenty Minutes](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/)
2. Go to [Git Immersion](https://gitimmersion.com/)
3. Follow those instructions. They will serve you well.
