# git-immersion-walkthrough

This repository is meant to be a guide to learning git via the Git Immersion tour.

This guide is meant to help data analysts or new analytics engineers get comfortable with git, the command line interface (CLI), and the principles behind version-control.

I am not the author(s) nor maintainers of the two tutorials linked below. I myself am still familiarizing myself with Git and the CLI. The intent in this guide is to share a resouce that I found extremely valuable in my analytics & data engineering journey, and to help address some of the challenges I ran into when working through these..
